# HorizonJS
A simple small js framework made to help me write more structured, readable code

## What it is:
Horizon is not meant to compete with other major javascript frameworks, like Angular, React etc, at least at this point. 

It is a small project created purely for the author's enjoyment and to explore some of the new ES6 features like promises, fetch API, template strings, fat arrow functions etc. The main idea is to try to seperate code and logic into distinctive objects that should be readable, maintable and reusable. 

There is also an in-built custom templating system built upon es6 template-strings. 

As you can expect this small framework targets modern browsers that utilize new es6 features. It goes without saying that it will not work on Internet Explorer (we should help on letting IE rest in peace)  

More info, code commenting/documentation and examples will come out in the next few days.
