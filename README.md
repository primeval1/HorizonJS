# HorizonJS
A dead simple small js framework. 

## What it is:
I is a dead simple javascript framework, created purely for the author's enjoyment and to explore some of the new ES6 features like promises, fetch API, template strings, fat arrow functions etc. The main idea is to try to seperate code and logic into distinctive objects that should be readable, maintable and reusable. 

There is also an in-built custom templating system built upon es6 template-strings. 

As you can expect this small framework targets modern browsers that utilize new es6 features. It goes without saying that it will not work on Internet Explorer (we should help on letting IE rest in peace). 

# Important
Do not use this code on production on even for building an application. Do yourself a favor and use a proper framework like Vue.js. 
This is mainly for exploring some ideas, which you can of course use them, if you find them usefull.
